Task 4:tmax value = 20, I thought this was a good time, as you could see the helicopter speed up on the short bits but, 
still see the entirety of the animation.

Task 5: I used s=5, as this will toggle to teleport the helicopter to the position where s = 5, then when toggled off
will go back to whatever s it is currently on based off of the time.
