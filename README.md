# Keyframing
This is the key framing assignment that I completed for my Computer Animation Class in the Fall of 2021 at Texas A&amp;M.

This assignment was created by Dr. Shijiro Sueda, and was meant to teach the basics of keyframing by using spline curves to connect the animation of a helicopter on a unique path, along with the arc length parameterization, so that we can get a uniform speed while traversing the curve. This project uses OpenGL and GLM libraries to animate the object, and a helicopter obj file as the focus of the project.

# How to Run
This is meant to be run using OpenGL, and while I will not go into extensive detail about how to download this, here is a tutorial from Dr. Sueda, so that you can run this project if you so desire. https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sueda/courses/CSCE489/2021F/labs/L00/index.html

# Commands while Running
* Ctrl + Click Drag to zoom in/out
* 'k' shows keyframes and spline curves (the path that the helicopter follows)
* 's' sends the helicopter to a predetermined location and has it continue hovering

# Recreating the Project
Here is the link to Dr. Sueda's assignment so that you can try this out yourself, all credit is to Dr. Sueda.
